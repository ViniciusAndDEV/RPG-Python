# RPG-Python

**My first Python project: a simple RPG battle simulator.**

## Description
This project is a basic RPG battle simulator written in Python. 
Players can fight against enemies, use items, and test simple game mechanics. 
It was created as my first programming project to practice Python concepts like functions, conditionals, and loops.

## How to Play
1. Run `main.py` in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Follow the prompts in the console to choose actions like attacking, using items, or healing.
3. Try to defeat all enemies without your health dropping to zero!

## Features
- Turn-based combat system
- Player and enemy stats
- Simple item usage (healing potions)
- Basic game loop

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

## Project Goal
This project is intended for learning purposes and as a demonstration of my Python skills. 
It helped me understand **functions, conditionals, loops, and basic game logic**.
